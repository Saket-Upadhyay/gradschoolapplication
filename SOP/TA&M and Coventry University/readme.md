# My 'other' SOPs
These are other SOPs I wrote.

Both were accepted to some extent but then retracted due to some reasons-

## 1. Texas A&M University (USA)
I assume this also passed the screening, one correction was needed from my side in the form to be considered for an interview. I did a soft-pass on this because I recieved a good offer from my favourite University hehe.

## 2. Coventry University (UK)
This SOP was submitted to Coverntry University, UK and Deakin University, Australia for an joint RFID Security Ph.D. project.
This is declined because my graduation from undergraduate college was not before 1st January 2022 which was their start date. You need to have a degree in hand before starting your Ph.D. somewhere else. :(
