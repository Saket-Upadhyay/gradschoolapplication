# Grad. School Application Resources.

![](https://github.com/Saket-Upadhyay/gradschoolapplication/blob/main/.social/SharePost.png)
Collection fo some handpicked resources from my last year's grad school applications that might help potential aspirants to have a reference point or "that one example" that will help them write their first paragraph of SoP (the most challenging part, in my opinion).

I got my acceptance letter from the University of Virginia (UVA), VA, USA for a fully-funded Ph.D. in Computer Science on the 5th of February 2022 (IST).

This is the profile that I used to apply for a Computer Science Ph.D. program at UVA after my undergraduate from the Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India.
My major in undergrad was Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and my minor was Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics.

> NOTE: As I applied for Fall 2022 intake, GRE requirements were waived for us; therefore, I don't have GRE scores or any kind of exam prep for the same.

### Scores

1. IELTS: **Overall = 8**; R = 9; L = 9; W = 7; S=7.5; (August 31, 2021; New Delhi, India)
2. CGPA : **8.6/10; 3.44/4.0** (B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering with specialisation in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics.)
3. GRE  : N/A
4. GATE : N/A

> Note: I used [https://www.admissions.iastate.edu/apply/gpa_calc](https://www.admissions.iastate.edu/apply/gpa_calc) to convert my scale 10 CGPA to scale 4.
