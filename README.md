# My Grad School Application

This repository has all the resources that a potential grad students can use as reference when working on their grad school application.

I got my acceptance letter from University of Virginia (UVA), VA, USA for fully funded Ph.D in Computer Science on 5th of February 2022 (IST)

This is the profile that I used to apply for a Computer Science Ph.D program at UVA after my undergraduate from Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India.

My major in undergrad was Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and my minor was Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics.

> NOTE: As I applied for Fall 2022 intake, GRE requirements were waived for us, therefore, I hadn't taken the GRE exam or any kind exam prep for the same.
