# My Grad School Application
This repository has some the resources that potential grad students can use as references when working on their grad school applications.

I got my acceptance letter from the University of Virginia (UVA), VA, USA for a fully-funded Ph.D. in Computer Science on the 5th of February 2022 (IST).

This is the profile that I used to apply for a Computer Science Ph.D. program at UVA after my undergraduate from the Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India.
My major in undergrad was Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and my minor was Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics.

> NOTE: As I applied for Fall 2022 intake, GRE requirements were waived for us, therefore, I hadn't taken the GRE exam or any kind of exam prep for the same.

### Scores
